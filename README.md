# Techorama 2023 MAUI Workshop

In this workshop we will use Windows to build an app. We will test on iOS and Android devices. We will talk a little bit about MacCatalyst (Mac Desktop). We will not cover Tizen devices, but they deserve honorable mention. The main focus will be on mobile devices.

Publishing to an app store is beyond the scope of this workshop. If you're interested in learning how to publish to the Google Play and Apple Stores, consider the four-part video series I recorded for my YouTube show, [The .NET Show](https://www.thedotnetshow.com/). Episodes 42, 43, 44, and 45 document me publishing an app that I built in episodes 28, 30, 31, and 33.
